## Pdf file 
Includes the working paper and models' description

## Main scripts:
"PIN fun.R" file includes the function for estimation of the PIN model (Easley et al, 1996) with incorporated algorithms to enhance its efficiency, using the observed order flow
"pin final.R" allows to change the frequency of the input data
"pin (parallel).R" uses parallel package to decrease the estimation time
"simulation for PIN.R" simulates theoretical data for pin algo to test its accuracy
"VPIN Automated Final.R" estimates VPIN metric and includes some extra codes line for shaping the input data
